<h1>Extra Info and Thoughts</h1>
<p class="meta">Posted on 6/1</p>

<h3>Political Spectrum</h3>
<p>The school leans left, like most universities. Lots of students are passionate about current issues and marginalized communities, often organizing events and protests on campus. Not all students are tolerant on both-sides of the issue, however, and students who are right-leaning may feel stifled.</p>

<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p>McGill and Montreal are diverse in demographic and has a mix of anglophone and francophone cultures. Most colleges and universities are already diverse, but I would say McGill is on the diverse end relative to other schools. You will find people from France, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and all provinces of Canada.</p>

<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>Most of the facilities and buildings are pretty old and not very pleasing to the eye. Most of the buildings were built in the 70s/80s and all have a concrete gray color. Don't expect remodeled interiors and new equipment. Some of the more historic buildings are aesthetic, but there aren't many and you likely won't be spending much time in them.
<br><br>
This is changing and the school has done a good job with improving the campus in my time there, construction is taking place year-round.</p>
