<h1>McGill University: The Cons</h1>
<p class="meta">Posted on 5/28</p>

<h3>Student Support</h3>
<p>McGill provides a poor support network for its students in terms of academics and health. The university largely leaves students to fend for themselves. It can be a jarring change coming from high school and students are forced to adapt quickly, or otherwise fail their courses.</p>

<h3>Academic Focused</h3> change emaphasis
<p>McGill is a research focused school and as a result, less emphasis is placed on the undergraduate students. This also leads the university to place heavy emphasis on academic rigour, to the annoyance of the student body. (edit 2nd part) This isn't all bad as it breeds displcine (spell check) and knowledge, however, certain infamous Computer Science courses tested my existence as a human being.</p>

<h3>Language Barrier</h3>
<p>While McGill is an English speaking university, the rest of Montreal is not, and it can be frustrating for anglophone students to deal with. The majority of Montreal the population speaks English, but it's on varying degrees of proficiency and some people are rude when you only speak English. I can fondly recall moments of absurdity and disrespect from people when they found out I couldn't speak French.</p>

<h3>Recruiting</h3>
<p>Not a lot of emphasis being placed on recruiting. (go into detail) Don't expect the school to offer great assistance in helping undergraduate students find internships or jobs outside of the yearly job fair. Networking and speaking events take place around the year, but are not emphasized by the school.
<br><br>
Management and Engineering faculties are better in this respect, however, other faculties are left out. This is one of the downsides of attending a research oriented school.</p>
