<h1>McGill University: the Pros</h1>
<p class="meta">Posted 5/27</p>

<h3>Campus and Location</h3>
<p>One of the unique parts about McGill is the school has a beautiful and spacious main campus, despite being in the heart of downtown Montreal. Downtown across the street from the main entrance (Roddick Gates), giving the students easy access to the metro (subway) systems and other shops on Rue St. Catherine.
<br><br>
The university is also located at the foot of a small mountain, Mount Royal, which surrounds the school with it's various parks and running trails. Saint-Laurent Boulevard, where a lot of the city's clubs and bars are located, is only a 10-15 minute walk from campus - a fact you will be grateful for at 5am in the morning. </p>

<h3>Social Scene</h3>
<p>McGill as a school embodies the mentality of work hard play hard. You can hear students going out every day of the week, especially early in the semester. Despite this, you can also find the same students in the library next morning at 9am because they have a midterm coming up. The school does not throw any big parties or tail-gates, but the nature of Montreal and the people around you lead to positive social scene.</p>


<h3>Drinking Age and Legalization</h3>
<p>One of the biggest pros about Montreal was the fact that 18 year olds could purchase alcohol, and more recently cannabis, freely. Coming from the US this was a great quality of life change that I took for granted. For those that do partake, legalization is a nice change if you are coming from outside of Canada. Laws in Quebec do impose certain restrictions, like only being able to purchase liquor at government owned SAQ stores and cannabis SQDC stores, but the pros outweigth the cons.</p>

<h3>Student City and Cheap Rent</h3>
<p>Montreal is the home to four major universities (McGill, Concordia, UQAM, UDEM), which in turn make it student friendly. Rent is very cheap compared to cities like Toronto and New York and it only gets cheaper the further you get from downtown. I was paying on average $650 CAD per month living with two other roommates, living 20 minutes away from campus.
<br><br>

Your neighbors are likely to be other students too who study at one of the Montreal schools. It's easy to meet new people and grow your social circle</p>

<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p>McGill and Montreal are diverse in demographic and I have gotten to meet tons of people I otherwise would have never met. Francophones are the majority of the population, but the city is relatively English friendly and the student body is diverse in both background and interest. 

<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>Tuition for McGill is relatively cheap for international students and extremely cheap for Canadian or Quebec residents. I was paying less than $5000 CAD for one year at McGill, which is insane when compared to schools in the US.</p>
