<h1>McGill University: the Pros</h1>
<p class="meta">Posted on 5/27</p>

<h3>Campus and Location</h3>
<p>One of the unique parts about McGill is the school has a beautiful and spacious main campus, despite being in the heart of downtown Montreal. Metro systems and other shops on Rue St. Catherine are across street from the main gates, giving students easy access. st laurent...
<br><br>
On the opposite of campus ...
The university is also located at the foot of a small mountain, Mount Royal, which surrounds the school with it's various parks and running trails. Saint-Laurent Boulevard, where a lot of the city's clubs and bars are located, is only a 10-15 minute walk from campus - a fact you will be grateful for at 5am in the morning. </p>

<h3>Social Scene</h3>
<p>McGill as a school embodies the mentality of work hard play hard. You can hear students going out every day of the week, especially early in the semester. Despite this, you can also find the same students in the library next morning at 9am because they have a midterm coming up. The school does not throw any big parties or tail-gates, but the nature of Montreal and the people around you lead to positive social scene. (remove part) frosh

No school spirit disclaimer etc. more social stuff </p>


<h3>Drinking Age and Legalization</h3> present tense, accimilated 
<p>One of the biggest pros about Montreal is the fact that 18 year olds could purchase alcohol, and more recently cannabis. Coming from the US this was a great quality of life change that I took for granted. For those that do partake, legalization is a nice change if you are coming from outside of Canada. Laws in Quebec do impose certain restrictions, like only being able to purchase liquor at government owned SAQ stores and cannabis SQDC stores, but the pros outweigh the cons. keep in mind etc. (elaborate sqdc etc)</p>

<h3>Student City and Cheap Rent</h3>
<p>Montreal is home to four major universities (McGill, Concordia, UQAM, UDEM), which in turn make it student friendly. Rent is very cheap compared to cities like Toronto, and New York and it only gets cheaper the further you get from campus. I was paying on average $650 CAD per month living with two other roommates, living 20 minutes away from campus (flip).
<br><br>

Your neighbors are likely to be other students who study at one of the Montreal schools, making it easy to meet new people and grow your social circle</p>

<h3>Diversity</h3>go more in depth, forces you out of comfort zone

<p>McGill and Montreal are diverse in demographic and I have gotten to meet tons of people I otherwise would have never met. Francophones are the majority of the population, but the city is relatively English friendly and the student body is diverse in both background and interest. 

<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>Tuition for McGill is relatively cheap for international students and extremely cheap for Canadian or Quebec residents. I was paying less than $5000 CAD for one year at McGill, which is insane when compared to schools in the US.</p>
